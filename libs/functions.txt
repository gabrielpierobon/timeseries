Set of Python functions for working with time series data, building and training a neural network model, and performing various tasks such as data preprocessing, backtesting, and forecasting. These functions are designed for time series forecasting tasks using a TSMixer-inspired model.

Here's a summary of the key functions and their purposes:

1. `load_and_preprocess_data`: Loads and preprocesses time series data, including handling missing values, resampling, and converting the index to datetime format.

2. `plot_loaded_data`: Plots the loaded time series data.

3. `build_tsmixer_model`: Defines a TSMixer-inspired neural network model for time series forecasting.

4. `train_tsmixer_model`: Trains the TSMixer-inspired model with options for early stopping.

5. `generate_dataset`: Generates input-output pairs for supervised learning from time series data.

6. `time_based_split`: Splits time series data into training and test sets based on a specified time point.

7. `scale_data`: Scales the data using Min-Max scaling and returns the scalers for inverse transformation.

8. `inverse_transform_array`: Inverse transforms a scaled array back to its original scale using the provided scalers.

9. `train_test_time_based_split`: Splits data into training and test sets for time-based evaluation.

10. `backtest_model`: Backtests the trained model, making sequential predictions and evaluating performance.

11. `predict_test_set`: Predicts values on a test set and visualizes the predictions.

12. `forecast_data`: Generates future forecasts using the trained model.

13. `mean_absolute_percentage_error`: Calculates the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for evaluation.

14. `evaluate_test_set`: Evaluates the performance of the model on the test set using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

15. `plot_test_set_predictions_with_history`: Plots test set predictions alongside the training data (history).

16. `plot_future_forecast_with_history`: Plots the history and future forecast of a DataFrame.

17. `log_experiment_to_mlflow`: Logs an experiment to MLflow, including the model, parameters, metrics, and artifacts.

18. `load_mlflow_experimental_model`: Loads a model from an MLflow experiment using the run ID and artifact name.

19. `load_mlflow_staged_model`: Loads a model from MLflow that is in a specific stage (e.g., Staging or Production).

These functions provide a comprehensive set of tools for working with time series data, building and training neural network models, and evaluating model performance. 

You can use these functions as building blocks for your time series forecasting projects.
