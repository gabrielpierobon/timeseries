Short description of your project.

### Setting up the environment

This project uses a virtual environment to manage dependencies. This helps in ensuring that the necessary dependencies are isolated from the global Python environment.

#### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. This project uses Python 3, so ensure you have the Python 3.x version.

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Before activating the virtual environment, navigate to the project directory (where the `venv` folder resides). Use the command:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

Replace `path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory.

#### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Depending on your operating system, the activation command differs.

- **Windows**:

  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

  The command prompt will change to indicate that the virtual environment is active.

- **macOS and Linux**:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

  The terminal prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment.

#### 4. Deactivate the Virtual Environment

After you've finished working in the virtual environment and want to return to the global Python environment, simply run:

```bash
deactivate
```

### Installing Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
